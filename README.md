# DOMoney

DOMoney is a JavaScript library which provides for DOM manipulation, event handling and AJAX requests via the native DOM API much in the way jQuery does.

## Features

DOMoney provides many of the familiar jQuery methods such as:

* find: finds all DOM elements that match a selector
* append: adds to the inner html of the elements it's called on
* attr: yields the first attribute of the element it's called on
* children: iterates over an array of elements returning their children
* parent: iterates over an array of elements returning their parents
